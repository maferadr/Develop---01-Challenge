# Develop---01-Challenge

## User Story
As A student
I WAS given a code for a Marketing Webpage to improve the User Experience through that.

## Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN the requirements to reach the company expectations:
WHEN the company review the source code
THEN they find semantic HTML elements
WHEN the company view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN they find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN the company view the icon and image elements
THEN they find accessible alt attributes
WHEN the company view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN the company view the title element
THEN they find a concise, descriptive title.

In order to make it more accesible, as a student I've been commented the source code in the HTML page.
